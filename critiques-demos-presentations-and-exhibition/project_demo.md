# Mid-Term Project Demos

## **Midterm Project Demo Prep**

* IF you haven't already, please sign up for a [padlet](http://padlet.com/) account so your name will be attributed to your comments.&#x20;
* You will find the room # and padlet you're assigned to in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9xOT\_r\_jnaPtbKW-pZMSXHni-UoA5cN-KGZrbMJg1E) .&#x20;
* **By or before Sunday, March 27, 2022, at noon EST**, please document your prototype(s) by posting the link(s) directly to the thing itself if it is a website (incl. soundcloud links), social media feed (instagram, etc), animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc to your group's respective padlet.&#x20;
* You can also show multiple assets for your project demo. Put each one in a separate padlet card. **I HIGHLY recommend that you revise your teaser video and have that be your first padlet card.**
* **Please look at the prototype(s) of the students in your assigned room BEFORE 2pm on midterm project demo day and leave comments for at least 3 students who are not in our section.** Also, leave comments for other students if you look at their projects on the other padlets. If everyone does this, you can spend less time talking and showing your project and more time getting feedback on your project

## **Midterm Project Demo Overview**

* **Review rules of the** [**critique (AKA giving and receiving feedback)**](broken-reference)**.**
* Think of this as a show and tell.
* Be prepared to deliver an elevator pitch of your project verbally.&#x20;
* Be prepared to demo the project at its current state.&#x20;
* When you share your prototype(s) to your group during your midterm demo, try to bypass showing it on your process website.&#x20;
* In other words, if you have images just show the images using preview, etc.&#x20;
* If you have created a website, animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc, go directly to that link in a web browser.&#x20;
* Alternatively, you can click on your padlet note and go fullscreen.&#x20;
* Discuss what does (and does not) your prototype(s) explore at this moment in time.&#x20;
* Quickly list next steps.&#x20;
* Come with questions to ask others about your project direction(s).

## **Midterm Project Demo Agenda**

* You will be paired with a student for 20 min total.&#x20;
* **Do not pair with a student from your own section.**&#x20;
* Each student in the pair will have 10 min total:
  * Up to 5 min for your presentation.&#x20;
  * The remaining time of your 10 min will be for feedback from the student you are paired with. You may or may not also be accompanied by a faculty or "outside of our class" critic(s) for feedback.&#x20;
* Then switch and repeat.&#x20;
* After 20 minutes, one student in the pair will move to the right; every student will be paired with a new student.&#x20;
* There will be 5 rounds of 20 minutes**.**

## Reminders

* **Do NOT create a supporting presentation.**
* Make sure you present the prototype(s) itself.
* Make sure your elevator pitch is just that. Short. 1 to 2 sentences maximum.
* Make sure you spend the bulk of your 5 min presenting your prototype(s).
* Use your entire 10 min. If students are not giving you feedback, ask them questions you are currently grappling with.
* There should be peer-to-peer feedback and conversation.
