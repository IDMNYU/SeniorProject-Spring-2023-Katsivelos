# Mid-Term Project Demos

## **Midterm Project Demo Prep**

*

## **Midterm Project Demo Overview**

* **Review rules of the** [**critique (AKA giving and receiving feedback)**](broken-reference)**.**
* Think of this as a show and tell.
* Be prepared to deliver an elevator pitch of your project verbally.&#x20;
* Be prepared to demo the project at its current state.&#x20;
* When you share your prototype(s) to your group during your midterm demo, try to bypass showing it on your process website.&#x20;
* In other words, if you have images just show the images using preview, etc.&#x20;
* If you have created a website, animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc, go directly to that link in a web browser.&#x20;
* Alternatively, you can click on your padlet note and go fullscreen.&#x20;
* Discuss what does (and does not) your prototype(s) explore at this moment in time.&#x20;
* Quickly list next steps.&#x20;
* Come with questions to ask others about your project direction(s).

## **Midterm Project Demo Agenda**

* You will be paired with a student for 20 min total.&#x20;
* **Do not pair with a student from your own section.**&#x20;
* Each student in the pair will have 10 min total:
  * Up to 5 min for your presentation.&#x20;
  * The remaining time of your 10 min will be for feedback from the student you are paired with. You may or may not also be accompanied by a faculty or "outside of our class" critic(s) for feedback.&#x20;
* Then switch and repeat.&#x20;
* After 20 minutes, one student in the pair will move to the right; every student will be paired with a new student.&#x20;
* There will be 5 rounds of 20 minutes**.**

## Reminders

* **Do NOT create a supporting presentation.**
* Make sure you present the prototype(s) itself.
* Make sure your elevator pitch is just that. Short. 1 to 2 sentences maximum.
* Make sure you spend the bulk of your 5 min presenting your prototype(s).
* Use your entire 10 min. If students are not giving you feedback, ask them questions you are currently grappling with.
* There should be peer-to-peer feedback and conversation.
